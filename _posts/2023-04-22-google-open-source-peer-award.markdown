About a month ago, I received an email from Google OSPB, which told me that I was nominated for the Google Open Source Peer Bonus award.

At that time, I couldn't believe it was true. After confirming repeatedly, I filled out the form. Recently, I received my award letter.

And I can't wait to share [it](/resouces/OS%20Peer%20Bonus%20H1%202023%20-%20Kyle%20Zhao%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.pdf) on my website:

In the past two years, I have contributed many patches to JGit, including performance optimization, refactoring, and various small features.

The most challenging work among them is the Commit-Graph feature, which [cgit](https://github.com/git/git) has actually implemented for a long time, and I have implemented it in JGit (refer to [Gerrit Code Review](https://git.eclipse.org/r/q/topic:commit-graph)) 

In the end, I would like to thank Ivan (our great committer) for believing that my work on JGit deserves to be recognized. We made a big deal!
